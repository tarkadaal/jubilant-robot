# Assumptions
- Jobs counts as stories
- "10 most used words for the first 100 comments for the top 30 stories" means the most used words across _all_ of those 3000 comments; this endpoint returns 10 words.
- Endpoint 3 should return the _10_ most used words in all comments; this number is not specified.
